# Cape Town Clojure User Group

## What we're up to

We are currently building a trading card game named **Steel Plains**!

* [**Steel Plains on GitHub**](https://github.com/cape-town-clojure/steel-plains-tcg) - [**Steel Plains Wiki**](https://github.com/cape-town-clojure/steel-plains-tcg/wiki)

We are learning to use these technologies from the [**Clojure**](http://clojure.org/) ecosystem to build it:

* [**Sente**](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente), a web-sockets library which can fall back to AJAX transparently. Provides server-side and client-side libraries.
* [**Datomic**](http://www.datomic.com), an immutable database.
* [**Om**](https://github.com/swannodette/om), an opinionated ClojureScript layer on top of Facebook's [**React.js**](http://facebook.github.io/react) library.

There is plenty to learn and do, here. Please feel free to join in! 

Just **contact any of the organisers below to get started**. We'd love to meet you!
